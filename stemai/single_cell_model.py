"""
Only a single bit of information in each direction crossing the blanket

pick one cell behind the blanket; that cell is connected to the seed cell, the other cells are not connected across the blanket 

* maybe that cell is connected to everyone 
* if seed cell divides then itâ€™s child will also be connected which is not ideal for experimenting 
* then we have to give the ABB the ability to grow 

so a potential way to implement that is symmetric division
